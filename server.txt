Setting Up serve.py as a Background Service
1. Change ip to 0.0.0.0 and port to 80 in serve.py

To ensure that your serve.py script continues to run even after you close your OpenOcean droplet console, follow these steps:

2. Create the Service File
--------------------------
Create a systemd service file to manage your script.

sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/serve.service


Add the following content to the file:
```
[Unit]
Description=My Serve Script
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /root/PolyScav/serve.py
Restart=always
User=root
WorkingDirectory=/root/PolyScav

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

3. Setup systemctl
Reload systemd to recognize the new service:
	sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Start the Service:
	sudo systemctl start serve.service

Enable the Service at Boot:
	sudo systemctl enable serve.service

Check the status of the service to ensure it's running correctly:
	sudo systemctl status serve.service

If the service fails to start, check the logs for error messages:
	sudo journalctl -u serve.service


4. Reload and Restart After Changes
After making any necessary changes, reload the systemd daemon and restart the service:
	sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	sudo systemctl restart serve.service
